# AI Artist Assistant Web

AI Artist Assistant Web is an open-source project aimed at building a community-driven platform for generating lyrics, songs, and potentially enabling chat functionality with famous artists and individuals who have passed away. The project is designed to be generic and adaptable, allowing it to be used with any artist or person for whom there is sufficient data.

This repository contains the frontend and backend code for the community-driven platform, where users can submit content, vote on submissions, flag content, and donate. It includes the web interface built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL, as well as the API for interacting with the AI models in the [ai-artist-assistant repository](https://github.com/nesimtunc/ai-artist-assistant).

## Features

- User-friendly interface: A modern and responsive web interface for users to interact with the platform.
- Content submission and voting: Users can submit content, vote on submissions, and flag inappropriate content.
Donations and Transparency: A transparent crowdfunding system to help support server costs, AI training resources, and community involvement, as well as to support selected charitable causes.
- API integration: The backend API communicates with the AI models in the `ai-artist-assistant` repository to generate content based on user submissions.
